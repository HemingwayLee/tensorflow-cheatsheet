## In some scenario, accuracy is not important
* False Positive (type I error) Precision: Spam detection, finger print locker 
* False Negative (type II error) Recall: Ads

## Both precision and recall are important
* F1 Score (F1 Measure): it is a special case in F Measure
* belta=1, F Measure =  F1 Measure
* belta=0, F Measure = Precision
* belta=infinity, F Measure = Recall
